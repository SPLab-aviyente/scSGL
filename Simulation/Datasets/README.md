Datasets are generated with genes as rows and cells as columns. The expression dataset is a lognormalized version of the actual simulated count data. The reference network has values -1 for a negative edge, +1 for a positive edge and 0 for no-edge. Density refers to the proportion of positive or negative edges in the reference network. In all these simulated datasets the proption of positive and negative edges are kept equal. So for example if the density is 0.1; it means that the proportion of positive edges in the refereence network is 0.05 and the proportion of negative edges is 0.05.
